## Challenges
### 1. Palindrome numbers

A palindromic number is a number (such as 626) that remains the same when its digits are reversed.
Write a function that returns true if a given number is a palindrome, and false, if it is not.
Complete the given function, so that the code in main works and results in the expected output.

Sample Input:
13431
Sample Output:
13431 is a palindrome
